# TicTacToe3D
just a sample project with threejs in tic tac toe game :-)
this project i made for my finalterm in GPU subject in my master degree in ITB.

hopefully i get A, haha :D
and you can learn something from this project


### want to learn?
for this project i tried to separate GUI and the game it self
- for game we can use tictactoejs, and AI with just random move
- and GUI using threejs encapsulated in one class (src: js/GUI.js)
- and you can see how we can integrate gui and the game in index.html (controller)

#### installation note
for simple, just use `bower install`
and let koala to compile less/main.less to css/main.css
